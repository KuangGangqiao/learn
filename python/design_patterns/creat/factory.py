# 工厂方法是一种创建型设计模式， 解决了在不指定具体类的情况下创建产品对象的问题。
# 工厂方法定义了一个方法， 且必须使用该方法代替通过直接调用构造函数来创建对象
#（ new操作符） 的方式。 子类可重写该方法来更改将被创建的对象所属类。

# 使用示例： 工厂方法模式在 Python 代码中得到了广泛使用。 当你需要在代码中提供高层次的灵活性时， 该模式会非常实用。
# 识别方法： 工厂方法可通过构建方法来识别， 它会创建具体类的对象， 但以抽象类型或接口的形式返回这些对象。

#概念示例

#本例说明了工厂方法设计模式的结构并重点回答了下面的问题：

#    它由哪些类组成？
#    这些类扮演了哪些角色？
#    模式中的各个元素会以何种方式相互关联？
