# 生成器是一种创建型设计模式， 使你能够分步骤创建复杂对象。
# 与其他创建型模式不同， 生成器不要求产品拥有通用接口。 这使得用相同的创建过程生成不同的产品成为可能。

# 使用示例： 生成器模式是 Python 世界中的一个著名模式。 当你需要创建一个可能有许多配置选项的对象时， 该模式会特别有用。
# 识别方法： 生成器模式可以通过类来识别， 它拥有一个构建方法和多个配置结果对象的方法。
# 生成器方法通常支持方法链 （例如 someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()）。

#概念示例

#本例说明了生成器设计模式的结构并重点回答了下面的问题：

#    它由哪些类组成？
#    这些类扮演了哪些角色？
#    模式中的各个元素会以何种方式相互关联？

        Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for
        retrieving results. That's because various types of builders may create
        entirely different products that don't follow the same interface.

        (at least in a statically typed programming language).

        Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.

        the `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory,
